# My First Foray into Plugin Develeopment for Neovim
A test repo for setup of a simple Nvim plugin. Likely to be more notes and readmes
than any meaningful code so I can reference back to this in future.

See [Teej and Bash](https://youtu.be/n4Lp4cV8YR0?t=2204) show setup for gloabl
vim internal debugging functions defined in 
[Teej's nvim config](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager/blob/master/xdg_config/nvim/lua/tj/globals.lua).
